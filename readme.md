### Vim config
This repository is to keep my vim configuration so that I can get my config anywhere I want!
(The bash codes are designed for ubuntu and ubuntu-based systems)

Enter the following commands to start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZunaedSifat/vim-config.git
cp -r vim-config/.vim ~/
cp vim-config/.vimrc ~/
~/.setup.sh
```

### Bingo! You are done!
